ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JoseLuisKoller and I will tell you somethings about me...
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything, I like learning from atoms to black holes, I like to know something about everything, that apassionates me and I find it fun, so don't be scared if you see very different projects from one to another
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and JS, and everyday studying more of Python/HTML/CSS

About me (Extended)
I'm from Neuquen, this is important, and I went to a secondary school of electronics, that is where I got my title of Electronic Technician and I got specialized in Automaticon and Control process 
that this gives me the ability to program PLC in industry areas. About the Electronic Technician title, I learned to make PCBs from the theory taking all the theory from the books, to software and then
into reality, having a lot of fun projects like sound reactive LEDs to an UltraSonnic Radar.

After graduating High School, I decided to go to college to study Software Engineering, learning Python and well that stuff you know... And besides college I strated to investigate and research about other things

And well, know I make things for fun and sometimes I get paid for them ðŸ˜ƒ
